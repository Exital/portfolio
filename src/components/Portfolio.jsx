        "My team and I have developed an IoT solution for collecting data and taking care of your home plants without consuming a lot of power. \
        We have used a raspberry pi as a local webserver and access point which can control up-to 6 end units which were built on ESP32 chip. \
        We have used several sensors such as soil moisture, temperature, light and uv in order to monitor the environment and its need for irrigation. \
        In order to be power efficient we have managed to use a deep sleep mode on the end point units and have come with a solution for low power irrigation system \
        which does not rely on pumps.",

        These models are capable of training on various kinds of melodies with multiple instruments to generate new melodies. \
        We utilized PyTorch as our framework and built both RNN and GAN models. \
        Throughout the project, we overcame numerous challenges, such as memory issues and theoretical obstacles related to music preprocessing. \
        Our results, tested via Google Forms, were impressive â€” participants couldn't distinguish between human-written and model-generated melodies. \
        Samples are available on my GitHub.",
